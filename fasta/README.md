Generate and write random DNA sequences.

Each program should:
* generate DNA sequences, by copying from a given sequence
* generate DNA sequences, by weighted random selection from 2 alphabets
  * convert the expected probability of selecting each nucleotide into cumulative probabilities
  * match a random number against those cumulative probabilities to select each nucleotide (use linear search or binary search)
  * Use this na√Øve linear congruential generator to calculate a random number each time a nucleotide needs to be selected (don't cache the random number sequence)

    ```
    IM = 139968
    IA = 3877
    IC = 29573
    Seed = 42
        
    Random Number:
    Seed = (Seed * IA + IC) modulo IM
    return float(Seed) / IM
    ```
