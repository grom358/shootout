# knucleotide
Hashtable of k-nucleotide strings.

Each program should:
 * read line-by-line a redirected FASTA format file from stdin
 * extract DNA sequence THREE
 * define a procedure/function to update a hashtable of k-nucleotide keys and
   count values, for a particular reading-frame â€” even though we'll combine
   k-nucleotide counts for all reading-frames (grow the hashtable from a small
   default size)
 * use that procedure/function and hashtable to
   * count all the 1-nucleotide and 2-nucleotide sequences, and write the code
     and percentage frequency, sorted by descending frequency and then ascending
     k-nucleotide key
   * count all the 3- 4- 6- 12- and 18-nucleotide sequences, and write the count
    and code for the specific sequences GGT GGTA GGTATT GGTATTTTAATT GGTATTTTAATTTATAGT
